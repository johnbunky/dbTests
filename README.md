# dbTests
Main goal: to automate a daily process of making bunch of requests, sorted these ones nd send results to a client. Ah..and get fun:)
So, a requests makes and results saves to .txt in @Test
Next, a letter with attached results  sends in @After
Finally, the scriptRunner that added to scheduler does it regularly
NOTE: I'm using Maven and Junit just because I suppose to use this script for db tests automation in future.
